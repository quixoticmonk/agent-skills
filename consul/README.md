- Health check configurations
- Service discovery patterns

**Use when**:
- Learning Consul service mesh basics
- Setting up simple service-to-service communication
- Implementing basic health checks

## 📚 Example Usage (Current Preview)

### Example 1: Basic Service Registration

```hcl
# Service definition for web-frontend
service {
  name = "web-frontend"
  id   = "web-frontend-1"
  port = 8080

  tags = ["web", "frontend", "production"]

  check {
    id       = "web-health"
    name     = "HTTP Health Check"
    http     = "http://localhost:8080/health"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "1s"
  }

  connect {
    sidecar_service {
      proxy {
        upstreams = [
          {
            destination_name = "api-backend"
            local_bind_port  = 8081
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Example 2: Basic Service Intentions

```hcl
# Allow web-frontend to communicate with api-backend
resource "consul_intention" "web_to_api" {
  source_name      = "web-frontend"
  destination_name = "api-backend"
  action           = "allow"
}

# Deny direct access from web-frontend to database
resource "consul_intention" "web_to_db" {
  source_name      = "web-frontend"
  destination_name = "database"
  action           = "deny"
}

# Allow api-backend to access database
resource "consul_intention" "api_to_db" {
  source_name      = "api-backend"
  destination_name = "database"
  action           = "allow"
}
```

---

### Example 3: Health Check Configuration

```hcl
# Comprehensive health checks
service {
  name = "api-backend"
  port = 8081

  # HTTP health check
  check {
    id       = "api-http"
    name     = "API HTTP Health"
    http     = "http://localhost:8081/health"
    method   = "GET"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "2s"
  }

  # TCP health check
  check {
    id       = "api-tcp"
    name     = "API TCP Connectivity"
    tcp      = "localhost:8081"
    interval = "30s"
    timeout  = "5s"
  }

  # TTL health check
  check {
    id   = "api-ttl"
    name = "API TTL"
    ttl  = "30s"
  }
}
```

2. Study official Consul documentation (see Resources below)
3. Try basic service registration locally
4. Experiment with simple intentions

### Intermediate
1. Set up Consul in development environment
2. Practice service discovery patterns
3. Implement health checks
4. Test service-to-service communication

### Advanced
1. Explore Consul's Terraform provider
2. Study enterprise features (namespaces, partitions)
3. Plan for multi-datacenter scenarios
4. Research observability integration

---

## 🔗 Current Integration Examples

### Terraform with Consul Provider

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    consul = {
      source  = "hashicorp/consul"
      version = "~> 2.18"
    }
  }
}

provider "consul" {
  address    = "localhost:8500"
  datacenter = "dc1"
}

# Register service via Terraform
resource "consul_service" "web_app" {
  name    = "web-app"
  node    = consul_node.app_server.name
  port    = 8080
  tags    = ["web", "production"]

  check {
    check_id = "web-app-health"
    name     = "Web App Health"
    http     = "http://localhost:8080/health"
    interval = "10s"
    timeout  = "1s"
  }
}

# Create intention
resource "consul_config_entry" "web_to_api_intention" {
  kind = "service-intentions"
  name = "api-backend"

  config_json = jsonencode({
    Sources = [
      {
        Name   = "web-frontend"
        Action = "allow"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

---

### Kubernetes with Consul

```yaml
# ServiceDefaults for web-frontend
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDefaults
metadata:
  name: web-frontend
spec:
  protocol: http
---
# ServiceIntentions for web → api
apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceIntentions
metadata:
  name: api-backend
spec:
  destination:
    name: api-backend
  sources:
    - name: web-frontend
      action: allow
```

## 🔄 Migration Note

If you're migrating from other service mesh solutions or service discovery tools:

**From Kubernetes Service Discovery**:
- Consul provides cross-platform service discovery (not just K8s)
- Native health checking without liveness/readiness probes
- Multi-datacenter federation built-in

**From Istio/Linkerd**:
- Consul works across VMs and containers
- Simpler operational model (no CRDs proliferation)
- Integrated KV store for configuration

**From DNS-based Discovery**:
- Dynamic health-aware updates
- More granular traffic management
- Built-in security (mTLS, intentions)

---

**Remember**: This is foundational content. Full Consul skills library coming soon!

**🌐 Service Mesh Simplified | 🔍 Discovery Made Easy | 🛡️ Security Built-In**
