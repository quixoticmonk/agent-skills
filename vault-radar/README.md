## 🎯 What's Inside

### Skills

**Skills** are discrete, reusable capabilities that teach AI agents specific Vault Radar tasks.

#### 🔍 [scan-for-secrets](skills/scan-for-secrets/)
**Purpose**: Detect hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials in code repositories and platforms

**Use when**:
- Auditing codebase for secret leaks
- Pre-commit validation
- CI/CD security checks
- Compliance audits (SOC2, PCI DSS)
- Incident response

**Example**:
```
@workspace Using vault-radar/skills/scan-for-secrets/, run:

Target: ./src/
Scan type: Offline (git repository)
Depth: Full history + uncommitted changes
Severity: HIGH and CRITICAL only
Output: JSON for MCP analysis
```

**Key Features**:
- **Online scanning**: GitHub, GitLab, Confluence, Jira, Slack
- **Offline scanning**: Local git repos, file systems, CI/CD artifacts
- **Severity levels**: CRITICAL (< 1hr), HIGH (< 24hr), MEDIUM (< 7d), LOW (backlog)
- **Pattern detection**: AWS keys, API tokens, private keys, database URLs, certificates
- **Git history**: Full commit history scanning
- **False positive filtering**: Context-aware analysis

---

#### 🤖 [integrate-mcp-server](skills/integrate-mcp-server/)
**Purpose**: Connect Vault Radar with AI agents via Model Context Protocol for intelligent analysis

## 🔧 Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Pre-Commit Secret Scan
```
@workspace Using vault-radar/skills/scan-for-secrets/:

Scan: Git staged files only
Mode: Offline (local)
Severity: All levels
Action: Block commit if CRITICAL or HIGH found
Output: Terminal (human-readable)
```

**Pre-commit Hook**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

echo "🔍 Scanning for secrets..."

# Scan staged files
vault-radar scan \
  --target git-staged \
  --format json \
  --output scan-results.json

# Check for CRITICAL or HIGH severity
CRITICAL_COUNT=$(jq '[.results[] | select(.severity == "CRITICAL")] | length' scan-results.json)
HIGH_COUNT=$(jq '[.results[] | select(.severity == "HIGH")] | length' scan-results.json)

if [ "$CRITICAL_COUNT" -gt 0 ] || [ "$HIGH_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKED: Secrets detected in commit"
  echo "  CRITICAL: $CRITICAL_COUNT"
  echo "  HIGH: $HIGH_COUNT"
  echo ""
  echo "Run: vault-radar scan --target git-staged"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ No secrets detected"
exit 0
```

---

### Use Case 2: CI/CD Pipeline Scan
```
@workspace Using vault-radar/skills/scan-for-secrets/:

Scan: Changed files in PR + 10 lines context
Mode: Offline (CI runner)
Severity: CRITICAL and HIGH fail build
Output: SARIF for GitHub Code Scanning

            exit 1
          fi
          
          echo "✅ No CRITICAL or HIGH secrets detected"
```

---

### Use Case 3: Full Repository Audit with MCP
```
@workspace Using vault-radar/skills/integrate-mcp-server/:

Action: Complete security audit
Target: Production API repository
MCP Server: Vault Radar
Analysis needed:
  1. Scan entire repo including git history
  2. Triage by severity (CRITICAL → LOW)
  3. Identify which secrets are still valid
  4. Generate rotation plan
  5. Suggest Vault migration strategy
  6. Create prevention roadmap
```

**Claude (with MCP) Conversation**:
```
User: Scan production-api repo for secrets

Claude: I'll use Vault Radar MCP to scan. Running now...
[MCP: vault-radar scan-repo production-api]

Results summary:
  CRITICAL: 3 findings
    - AWS access key (still active, last used 2 days ago)
    - Database password (admin account, prod DB)
    - Stripe secret key (live mode, payment processing)
  
  HIGH: 7 findings
    - GitHub personal access tokens (2)
    - API keys for 3rd party services (5)
  
  MEDIUM: 12 findings
  LOW: 45 findings

Immediate actions required:

1. CRITICAL - Rotate within 1 hour:
   a) AWS: Create new IAM user, update app config, revoke old
   b) Database: ALTER USER password, update connection strings
   c) Stripe: Generate new secret key in dashboard, deploy update

2. Remediation plan:
   - Scrub git history (BFG Repo-Cleaner)
   - Migrate to Vault (dynamic secrets for DB, KV for API keys)
   - Implement pre-commit hooks
   - Add CI/CD scanning

Would you like me to generate rotation scripts?
```

---

### Use Case 4: Incident Response - Secret Exposed in Public Repo
```
@workspace Apply vault-radar/workflows/triage-and-remediate.md:

Incident: AWS keys committed to public GitHub repo
Discovered: 30 minutes ago
Exposure: Public for 2 hours
Repository: company/web-app (public)
Severity: CRITICAL

Execute 6-phase workflow:
1. Scan - Confirm exposure
2. Triage - CRITICAL (public repo)
3. Contain - Rotate AWS keys IMMEDIATELY
4. Remediate - Remove from code + scrub git history
5. Migrate - Move to Vault dynamic AWS secrets
6. Prevent - Pre-commit hooks + CI/CD gates
```

**Incident Response Timeline**:
```
T+0 min:  Secret detected in public repo
T+5 min:  CRITICAL triage confirmed
T+10 min: AWS keys rotated (emergency procedure)
T+15 min: Verify old keys are revoked
T+30 min: Git history scrubbed (BFG Repo-Cleaner)
T+45 min: New keys in Vault (dynamic AWS engine)
T+60 min: Pre-commit hook deployed
T+90 min: Incident report completed
```

## 🛡️ Security Principles

All Vault Radar skills follow these security-first principles:

✅ **Always**:
- Scan before commit (pre-commit hooks)
- Scan in CI/CD (block on CRITICAL/HIGH)
- Rotate immediately on detection (don't just delete)
- Scrub git history (secrets persist in commits)
- Migrate to Vault (centralized secrets management)
- Implement prevention (layered security)
- Audit all secret access (compliance trail)
- Use progressive disclosure (AI agents)
- Prioritize by severity (CRITICAL < 1hr)
- Document all findings and remediation

❌ **Never**:
- Delete secrets without rotation (still valid!)
- Skip git history scrubbing (commits are permanent)
- Ignore LOW severity (technical debt compounds)
- Rely on rotation alone (prevention > detection)
- Log secret values during scanning
- Share scan results publicly (contain exposure)
- Skip verification after remediation
- Treat all findings equally (severity matters)

---

## 🔗 Integration Examples

### Pre-commit Hook (Advanced)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Reference: vault-radar/skills/scan-for-secrets/

set -e

echo "🔍 Vault Radar: Scanning staged files..."

# Create temp file for results
RESULTS_FILE=$(mktemp)

# Scan staged files
vault-radar scan \
  --target git-staged \
  --format json \
  --output "$RESULTS_FILE" \
  2>/dev/null || true

# Parse results by severity
CRITICAL=$(jq -r '[.results[] | select(.severity == "CRITICAL")] | length' "$RESULTS_FILE")
HIGH=$(jq -r '[.results[] | select(.severity == "HIGH")] | length' "$RESULTS_FILE")
MEDIUM=$(jq -r '[.results[] | select(.severity == "MEDIUM")] | length' "$RESULTS_FILE")

# Cleanup
rm -f "$RESULTS_FILE"

# Decision logic
if [ "$CRITICAL" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ BLOCKED: $CRITICAL CRITICAL secrets detected"
  echo ""
  echo "CRITICAL findings must be resolved before commit."
  echo "Run: vault-radar scan --target git-staged"
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$HIGH" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: $HIGH HIGH severity secrets detected"
  echo ""
  echo "HIGH findings should be resolved before commit."
  echo "Run: vault-radar scan --target git-staged"
  echo ""
  read -p "Override and commit anyway? (yes/no): " OVERRIDE
  if [ "$OVERRIDE" != "yes" ]; then
    exit 1
  fi
fi

if [ "$MEDIUM" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "ℹ️  INFO: $MEDIUM MEDIUM severity findings (not blocking)"
fi

echo "✅ Vault Radar: Scan complete"
exit 0
```

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding new Vault Radar skills or workflows:

1. **Follow progressive disclosure**: Don't expose secrets unnecessarily
2. **Include severity guidance**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
3. **Provide remediation steps**: Not just detection
4. **Add prevention measures**: Pre-commit, CI/CD integration
5. **Document MCP integration**: For AI agent automation
6. **Update this README**: Add your skill/workflow to relevant sections

---

## 💡 Tips for AI Agents

When using these instructions:

1. **Always use progressive disclosure**: Don't reveal secret values unless explicitly requested
2. **Prioritize by severity**: CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
3. **Rotate, don't just delete**: Secrets remain valid after removal
4. **Scrub git history**: Commits are permanent without BFG/git-filter-repo
5. **Implement layered prevention**: Pre-commit + CI/CD + runtime monitoring
6. **Migrate to Vault**: Dynamic secrets preferred over static
7. **Verify remediation**: Rescan after fixes applied
8. **Document everything**: Audit trail for compliance

---

**Remember**: Exposed secrets are compromised secrets. Complete remediation means rotation + removal + migration + prevention.

**🔒 Detect Fast | 🚨 Rotate Immediately | 🛡️ Prevent Always**
